Q2 What are the Code Environments? and its Types.
Code environment is a platform that consists of equipment that can be used for scripting codes, execution, developing, or testing the software.
Environments are independent: you can install different packages or different versions of packages in different environments without interaction between them.
So a complete integrated platform is provided.

There are 3 types of environments:
Text Editors:
In this programmer can write and modify the code only. These are general text editors.
e.g Notepad,Visual Studio Code,Atom...
*Integrated Development Environment
All the essential tools are installed for automating the programmer's tasks like file management, selections, debug, integrations, and deployments.
e.g PyCharm, Spyder....
Notebook Environment:
Ex in Jupyter Notebook we give input and get output of the code.
We can download files as .py and also in other formats and allow line by line execution.
